# naniar 0.0.6.9000

## Defunct functions

* As stated in 0.0.5.9000, to address [Issue #38](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar/issues/38), I am moving towards the format miss_type_value/fun, because it makes more sense to me when tabbing through functions.

The left hand side functions have been made defunct in favour of the right hand side.
    - `percent_missing_case()`  --> `miss_case_pct()`
    - `percent_missing_var()`   --> `miss_var_pct()`
    - `percent_missing_df()`    --> `miss_df_pct()`
    - `summary_missing_case()`  --> `miss_case_summary()`
    - `summary_missing_var()`   --> `miss_var_summary()`
    - `table_missing_case()`   --> `miss_case_table()`
    - `table_missing_var()`    --> `miss_var_table()`

# naniar 0.0.5.9000 (2016/01/08)

## Deprecated functions

* To address [Issue #38](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar/issues/38), I am moving towards the format miss_type_value/fun, because it makes more sense to me when tabbing through functions.
* `miss_*` = I want to explore missing values
* `miss_case_*` = I want to explore missing cases
* `miss_case_pct` = I want to find the percentage of cases containing a missing value
* `miss_case_summary` = I want to find the number / percentage of missings in each case
`miss_case_table` = I want a tabulation of the number / percentage of cases missing

This is more consistent and easier to reason with.

Thus, I have renamed the following functions:
    - `percent_missing_case()`  --> `miss_case_pct()`
    - `percent_missing_var()`   --> `miss_var_pct()`
    - `percent_missing_df()`    --> `miss_df_pct()`
    - `summary_missing_case()`  --> `miss_case_summary()`
    - `summary_missing_var()`   --> `miss_var_summary()`
    - `table_missing_case()`   --> `miss_case_table()`
    - `table_missing_var()`    --> `miss_var_table()`

These will be made defunct in the next release, 0.0.6.9000 ("The Wood Between Worlds"). 

# naniar 0.0.4.9000 (2016/12/31)

## New features

* `n_complete` is a complement to `n_miss`, and counts the number of complete values in a vector, matrix, or dataframe.

## Bug fixes

* `shadow_shift` now handles cases where there is only 1 complete value in a vector.

## Other changes

* added much more comprehensive testing with `testthat`.

# naniar 0.0.3.9901 (2016/12/18)

## New features

* `add_n_miss` and `add_prop_miss` are helpers that add columns to a dataframe containing the number and proportion of missing values. An example has been provided to use decision trees to explore missing data structure as in [Tierney et al](bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/6/e007450.full)

* `geom_miss_point()` now supports transparency, thanks to @seasmith (Luke Smith)
 
# naniar 0.0.3.9000 (2016/12/18)

After a burst of effort on this package I have done some refactoring and thought hard about where this package is going to go. This meant that I had to make the decision to rename the package from ggmissing to naniar. The name may strike you as strange but it reflects the fact that there are many changes happening, and that we will be working on creating a nice utopia (like Narnia by CS Lewis) that helps us make it easier to work with missing data

## New Features (under development)

* more shadows. These are mainly around `bind_shadow` and `gather_shadow`, which are helper functions to assist with creating 

## Bug fixes

* `geom_missing_point()` broke after the new release of ggplot2 2.2.0, but this is now fixed by ensuring that it inherits from GeomPoint, rather than just a new Geom. Thanks to Mitchell O'hara-Wild for his help with this.

* missing data summaries `table_missing_var` and `table_missing_case` also now return more sensible numbers and variable names. It is possible these function names will change in the future, as these are kind of verbose.

* semantic versioning was incorrectly entered in the DESCRIPTION file as  0.2.9000, so I changed it to 0.0.2.9000, and then to 0.0.3.9000 now to indicate the new changes, hopefully this won't come back to bite me later. I think I accidentally did this with visdat at some point as well. Live and learn.

## Other changes

* gathered related functions into single R files rather than leaving them in 
their own.

* correctly imported the `%>%` operator from magrittr, and removed a lot of chaff around `@importFrom` - really don't need to use `@importFrom` that often.

# ggmissing 0.0.2.9000 (2016/07/29)
=========================

## New Feature (under development)

- `geom_missing_point()` now works in a way that we expect! Thanks to Miles McBain for working out how to get this to work.


# ggmissing 0.0.1.9000 (2016/07/29)
=========================

## New Feature (under development)

- tidy summaries for missing data: 
    + `percent_missing_df` returns the percentage of missing data for a data.frame
    + `percent_missing_var` the percentage of variables that contain missing values
    + `percent_missing_case` the percentage of cases that contain missing values.
    + `table_missing_var` table of missing information for variables
    + `table_missing_case` table of missing information for cases
    + `summary_missing_var` summary of missing information for variables (counts, percentages)
    + `summary_missing_case` summary of missing information for variables (counts, percentages)
- gg_missing_col: plot the missingness in each variable
- gg_missing_row: plot the missingness in each case
- gg_missing_which: plot which columns contain missing data.
