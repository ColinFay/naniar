`naniar` aims to make it easy to summarise, visualise, and manipulate missing data. Currently it provides:

- Data structures for missing data
    + `as_shadow`
    + `bind_shadow`
    + `gather_shadow`
    + `is_na`
- Visualisation methods: 
    + `geom_missing_point`
    + `gg_missing_var`
- Numerical summaries: 
    + `n_miss`
    + `percent_missing_*`
    + `summary_missing_*`
    + `table_missing_*`

For a more formal description, you can read the vignette "building on ggplot2 for exploration of missing values".

**Why `naniar`?**

`naniar` was previously named `ggmissing` and initially provided a ggplot geom and some visual summaries. It was changed to `naniar` to reflect the fact that this package is going to be bigger in scope, and is not just related to ggplot2. Specifically, the package is designed to provide a suite of tools for generating visualisations of missing values and imputations, manipulate, and summarise missing data. 

> But why `naniar`?

Well, I think it is useful to think of missing values in data being like this other dimension, perhaps like Narnia - a different world, hidden away. Close, but very different. So the name, "naniar", is a play on the "Narnia" books. e.g., naniar: The Last Battle (...with missing data). Also, `NA`niar, naniar = na in r, and if you so desire, naniar may sound like "noneoya" in an nz/aussie accent.

# Data structures for missing data

Representing missing data structure is achieved using the shadow matrix, introduced in [Swayne and Buja](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2758672_Missing_Data_in_Interactive_High-Dimensional_Data_Visualization). The shadow matrix is the same dimension as the data, and consists of binary indicators of missingness of data values, where missing is represented as "NA", and not missing is represented as "!NA". Although these may be represented as 1 and 0, respectively. This representation can be seen in the figure below, adding the suffix "_NA" to the variables. This structure can also be extended to allow for additional factor levels to be created. For example 0 indicates data presence, 1 indicates missing values, 2 indicates imputed value, and 3 might indicate a particular type or class of missingness, where reasons for missingness might be known or inferred. The data matrix can also be augmented to include the shadow matrix, which facilitates visualisation of univariate and bivariate missing data visualisations. Another format is to display it in long form, which facilitates heatmap style visualisations. This approach can be very helpful for giving an overview of which variables contain the most missingness. Methods can also be applied to rearrange rows and columns to find clusters, and identify other interesting features of the data that may have previously been hidden or unclear.

# Visualising missing data

Visualising missing data might sound a little strange - how do you visualise something that is not there?  One approach to visualising missing data comes from ggobi and manet, where we replace "NA" values with values 10% lower than the minimum value in that variable. This is provided with the `geom_missing_point()` ggplot2 geom, which we can illustrate by exploring the relationship between Ozone and Solar radiation from the airquality dataset.


```{r regular-geom-point}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Solar.R)) +
  geom_point()

```

ggplot2 does not handle these missing values, and we get a warning message about the missing values.

We can instead use the `geom_missing_point()` to display the missing data

```{r geom-missing-point}

library(naniar)

ggplot(data = airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Solar.R)) +
  geom_missing_point()

```

`geom_missing_point()` has shifted the missing values to now be 10% below the minimum value. The missing values are a different colour so that missingness becomes pre-attentive.

This plays nicely with other parts of ggplot, like adding transparency

```{r}

ggplot(data = airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Solar.R)) +
  geom_missing_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

Thanks to Luke Smith for making this pull request.

like faceting - we can split the facet by month:

```{r}
p1 <-
ggplot(data = airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Solar.R)) + 
  geom_missing_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Month, ncol = 2) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p1

```

And then change the theme, just like you do with any other ggplot graphic

```{r}

p1 + theme_bw()  

```

You can also look at the proportion of missings in each variable with gg_missing_var:

```{r}

gg_missing_var(airquality)

```

You can also explore the whole dataset of missings using the `vis_miss` function from the [`visdat`](github.com/njtierney/visdat) package.

```{r}

# devtools::install_github("njtierney/visdat")
library(visdat)
vis_miss(airquality)

```

Another approach can be to use **Univariate plots split by missingness**. We can do this using the `bind_shadow` argument to place the data and shadow side by side. This allows for us to examine univariate distributions according to the presence or absence of another variable. 

```{r}
library(naniar)

aq_shadow <- bind_shadow(airquality)

aq_shadow
```


The plot below shows the values of temperature when ozone is present and missing, on the left is a faceted histogram, and on the right is an overlaid density.

```{r bind-shadow-density, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 10, results = "hold"}

library(ggplot2)

p1 <- ggplot(data = aq_shadow,
       aes(x = Temp)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~Ozone_NA,
             ncol = 1)

p2 <- ggplot(data = aq_shadow,
       aes(x = Temp,
           colour = Ozone_NA)) + 
  geom_density() 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)

```


# Numerical summaries for missing data

`naniar` provides numerical summaries of missing data. The `percent_missing_*` functions help find the proportion of missing values in the data overall, in cases, or in variables. 

```{r numerical-percent-missing}

# Proportion elements in dataset that contains missing values
percent_missing_df(airquality)
# Proportion of variables that contain any missing values
percent_missing_var(airquality)
 # Proportion of cases that contain any missing values
percent_missing_case(airquality)

```

We can also look at the number and percent of missings in each case and variable with `summary_missing_case`, and `summary_missing_var`.

```{r}

summary_missing_case(airquality)
summary_missing_var(airquality)

```

Tabulations of the number of missings in each case or variable can be calculated with `table_missing_case` and `table_missing_var`. 

```{r}

table_missing_case(airquality)
table_missing_var(airquality)

```

All functions can be called at once using `summarise_missingness`, which takes a `data.frame` and then returns a nested dataframe containing the percentages of missing data, and lists of dataframes containing tally and summary information for the variables and cases. 

```{r}

s_miss <- summarise_missingness(airquality)

s_miss

# overall % missing data
s_miss$percent_missing_df

# % of variables that contain missing data
s_miss$percent_missing_var

# % of cases that contain missing data
s_miss$percent_missing_case

# tabulations of missing data across cases
s_miss$table_missing_case

# tabulations of missing data across variables
s_miss$table_missing_var

# summary information (counts, percentrages) of missing data for variables and cases
s_miss$summary_missing_var
s_miss$summary_missing_case

```

# Other plotting functions {#extraplots}

These dataframes from the tidying functions are then used in these plots

## gg_missing_var

```{r}

gg_missing_var(airquality)

```


## gg_missing_case

```{r}

gg_missing_case(airquality)

```

## gg_missing_which

This shows whether a given variable contains a missing variable. In this case grey = missing. Think of it as if you are shading the cell in, if it contains data.

```{r}

gg_missing_which(airquality)

```


# Future Work

`naniar` will be undergoing more changes over the next 6 months, with plans to have the package in CRAN around the end of 2016. 

Other plans to extend the `geom_missing` family to include:

- 1D, univariate distribution plots
- Categorical variables
- Bivariate plots: Scatterplots, Density overlays.
- Provide
