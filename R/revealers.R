# derive_shadows:
# helpers to clear up common representations of missing values
# such as "NA", "N/A", etc.
# and might allow for an easier way for users to describe different
# missing data codes, such as -99, which might indicate missing, but
# some other kind of missing value, perhaps a different mechanism of
# missingness
# ideas for function names:
# narify (play on clarify)
# darken ()
# shade
# refract

# Other commands that might be useful?
# `is_na`
# `fill_na`
# `drop_na`
# `is_null`
